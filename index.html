            <p>Hello! Welcome to my first website. As I plan to become a software developer in the near future (after graduation) itâ€™s very important for me to know the front end and back end of a website to create a smooth, easy yet interesting experience for a client/user. This website will be representing my aims, my actions in order to achieve these aims. As this is the beginning of me studying web development this will be a basic website but as I follow along the course, I will be updating this website with CSS and JavaScript. I also plan to upload my projects. At the end of this semester, this website should serve me as a portfolio in the future which I can use to show my clients. I also plan to have different section on the website which will lead to some of my favorite website and tech companies who inspire me to become a software developer. I also plan to include my favorite books which I like reading and their pdf link for people to purchase and read if they are interested in it. Under contacts, I will be linking my social media accounts and mail so that if the user wants to contact me they can contact me through the links.</p>
